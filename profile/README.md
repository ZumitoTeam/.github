# About us

Our team was formed from experience gained in creating Discord bots over a long period of time. Over time, our code base grew significantly and we realized that we could create a more efficient and effective framework.

We set to work and developed a framework that we felt was so powerful that we decided to share it with the Discord community. Thus was born our organization on GitHub, which provides innovative tools and a state-of-the-art framework for creating custom bots on Discord.

We pride ourselves on working together in a collaborative environment to keep our code up to date and accessible to all Discord developers. If you're looking for a team that has experience and cares about the quality of their work, join us and discover what we can achieve together on Discord!
